### Hi there 👋

🧰 Among other things, I like to build softwares that solves business problems that I emphasize to understand and express thanks to technics taken from Domain Driven Design. Once I'm confident that I'm building the right thing, I like to try my best to build it the right way (applying technics like Hexagonal Architecture, CQRS, Event Sourcing, BDD, Continuous Integration, [Outside-In Diamond Strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djdMp9i04Sc), whenever they make sense, for instance).

💻 I mostly write French, English, PHP, JS, a bit of CSS, and hack from time to time on Arduino. My IDE is Arch Linux and my text editor is NeoVim.

📖 I'm reading articles or watching talks about Modular Monolith, Domain Modelling, CQRS/Event Sourcing, Event Driven Architecture in general or common development concepts (paradigms, guides like CUPID/SOLID, testing and legacy evolution strategies, ...).

📝 I sometimes write [blog posts](https://gquemener.github.io/)
