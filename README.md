### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ§° Among other things, I like to build softwares that solves business problems that I emphasize to understand and express thanks to technics taken from Domain Driven Design. Once I'm confident that I'm building the right thing, I like to try my best to build it the right way (applying technics like Hexagonal Architecture, CQRS, Event Sourcing, BDD, Continuous Integration, [Outside-In Diamond Strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djdMp9i04Sc), whenever they make sense, for instance).

ðŸ’» I mostly write PHP, JS, a bit of CSS, and hack from to time to time on Arduino. My IDE is Arch Linux and my text editor is Vim.

ðŸ“– I'm reading articles or watching talks about Event Sourcing, Event Driven Architecture in general or common development concepts (paradigms, guides like CUPID/SOLID, testing and legacy evolution strategies, ...).

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate within team where the mentionned points resonate :)
